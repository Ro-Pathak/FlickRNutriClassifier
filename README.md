# FlickRNutriClassifier

Problem Description

People are becoming more health conscious and interested in tracking their calorie intake.

An image classifier that can provide nutritional information based on the picture of the food taken could be a unique selling point for calorie-tracking apps.

We plan to scrape data using the FlickrAPI package to create an image classifier for food items and use it to output nutritional values of the respective food item.
