<h2>Problem Description</h2>
<p>With people ever getting more health conscious, the popularity of
calorie-tracking apps is on the raise. Though gimmicky, the addition of
an image classifier to such an app that can provide nutritional
information based on the picture of the food taken could be a unique
selling point and give a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>The primary data will be scraped using FlickrAPI. For this puepose,
the R package FlickrAPI is to be used to interface with the API. These
images will be used to create an image classifier. The classifier will
be used to classify new images and then output the nutritional values of
the respective food item.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2>Analytics Plan</h2>
<div class="section level4">
<h4>Data Scraping</h4>
<p>getPhotoSearch method from the FlickrAPI package is used to find the
most “Interesting” pics under a certain tag and retrieve all metadata
about the photos. Further download.file method is further used to
download the photos scraped URLs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4>Data Processing</h4>
<p>The photos are to be processed and manipulated for improving model
performance and efficiency. Some of the planned steps include,</p>
<p>1.Resizing: Resizing images to a fixed size to ensure that images are
all the same size, which is required by many some neural network
architectures.</p>
<p>2.Normalization: Normalizing the pixel values of the images to have
zero mean and unit variance</p>
<p>3.Color conversion: Converting images to grayscale</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2>Model Building</h2>
<p>70% of the scraped and processed images are to be used for the model.
Keras and Tensorflow are to be used for building the convoluted neural
network (CNN).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Define the model architecture which would involve specifying the
layers of the neural network, including the input layer, convolution
layers, pooling layers, and dense layers. The exact architecture is yet
to be decided.</p></li>
<li><p>Compile the model by specifying the optimizer, loss function, and
metrics to be used during training. The level of metrics to be
decided.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the fit function to train the model.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2>Evaluation Plan</h2>
<p>The data will be initial split into 70% for training &amp; 30% for
test. The 20% will be used to evaluate the performance of the model
using metrics such as accuracy, loss, precision, recall for each class
of classification.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4>Tuning the model</h4>
<p>Identify the classes that are not performing optimally and either
perform Hyper parameter tuning by adjusting factors such as learning
rate, batch size, number of epochs, etc. or increasing the training set
for the particular class that is not performing optimally.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4>Deploying the model</h4>
<p>A simple user interface to be build wherein if a picture is uploaded
the food item in the picture is identified and further the nutritional
info is displayed. Food item to calorific content mappings to be scraped
from US Dept of Agriculture Website.</p>
